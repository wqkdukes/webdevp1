          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p >â€‹I've been fascinated by art and photography for as long back as I can remember, so there's never really 
            been any question in my mind about what career path I'd take in life. As a visual communication professional, 
            I've worked a wide variety of jobs over the years - graphic designer, illustrator, painter, sculptor, and most 
            recently, photographer. I strive to maintain a high level of quality, creativity and originality in all of 
            the work that I produce. Most importantly, providing my customers with images that exceed their expectations 
            is always my ultimate objective.</p>
