    <h1>Project Report</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>I made this website as a basic proof of concept for my stepdad. He's a freelance arist, and does a lot of his work online so having his
            own website would be great.
        </li>
        <li>
            All images are originally from David Kennedy and all of the HTML/CSS was developed by me.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are five pages the home/landing page, an about page, a gallery, a page giving information about pricing, and a page to contact David through a form.
        </li> load apache
        <li>
            There is a consistent header across the top of the screen that is on every page.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can click on the David Kennedy Photography logo in the top left which will take you to the homepage. 
            From there you can click the images to navigate between pages.
        </li>
        <li>
            I use media queries to stack things on top of eachother when the screen width becomes too narrow.
        </li>
        <li>
            Many of the pages share the same styles, most of them pulling from style.css. 
            With the exception of gallery which uses some special css in order to display all the images correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
            All images have alt tags that describe that images purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each page has a camera as its favicon.
        </li>
        <li>
            All images and css files are placed into their own folders.
        </li>
        <li>
            No libraries or frameworks used.
        </li>
        <li>
            All pages were validated after I ran them through the validator and fixed them up.
        </li>
        <li>
            I think the layout of my site was best served by keeping my elements centered. Though when I had lines of text I would keep it left-aligned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spacing and font sizing is consistent across pages.
        </li>
        <li>
            All of the different pages have them same font while the header is unique.
        </li>
        <li>
            There is a form for contacting David on the contact page.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the top right in the header there are external links to Davids Instagram and LinkedIn pages.
        </li>
        <li>
            Source code is readable-ish ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. 
        </li>
        <li>
            When a page loads in the header will subtlely fade in.
        </li>
        <li>
            Website has been shared to user twodee.
        </li>
        <li>
            All file names are lowercase.
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Unfortunately I wasn't able to start the project as soon as I wanted to and so didn't have a steady stream of commits.
        </li>
        <li>
            Theres a recursion joke somewhere.
        </li>
